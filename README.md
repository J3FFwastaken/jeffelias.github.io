## About Me!
Ever since I was a primary school student, I have always tasted the essence of what it is like to be a leader by being a class monitor. As a current student at Westwood Secondary School who holds two respectable leadership roles: Senior Student Councillor and The Overall In-Charge of Westwood's National Police Cadet Corps (OIC of WWNP), I have mastered the values that require one to become a good leader: resilience, empathy, and integrity. These values have impacted my desire to excel not only as an individual in all aspects of life but with my fellow peers as well. Values such as discipline and commitment make me a dynamic team player and leader.
